## Laser-Based Interactive Musical Instrument
We propose to build a laser-based interactive musical instrument: a device that allows users to play different sounds through the interaction with a series of laser rays. The user will step into the center of an arrangment of standing eclectic speakers, and will control an instrument that bridges the gap between electronic buzzers and classic glass harmonica.

## Team
- Jimmy Xu
- Mark Unger
- Ryan Ong

## Summary
The device is made up of two parts: (1) a series of buzzers surrounding (2) a central control box. Each buzzer is mounted on top of a post and is connected to the box in the center. The box consists of a number of laser diodes and an equal number of photoresistors. The diodes are placed on one side of the box and emit laser to the photoresistors that are on the other side of the box. The Feather Board reads the resistance and changes the sound (frequency, pitch, interval, etc.) of the buzzers accordingly.

## Components

### Hardware
- Piezzo Buzzers
- Laser diodes
- Photoresistors
- Laser Refractors (Prisms/Mirrors)
- PVC Pipes
- Bowls (Metal/Glass)
- Water
- Box

### Software
The program will detect the simultaneous change in resistance of different photoresistors caused by the user altering the paths of the lasers, and will adjust the collective frequency/harmonics of the buzzers accordingly.

## Challenges
Since we have spent half of our time on ideating, we have limited amount of time to implement our idea. 
Assembling unfamiliar components can be difficult.
Integrating all components together can be messy and time-consuming.

## Timeline
- Week 1: (passed) Ideation.
- Week 2: (passed) Ideation.
- Week 3: Build the instrument. Order components as needed. Finish most of the hardware. 
- Week 4: Write the control program. Integrate all components. Polish the design.
- Week 5: Final adjustments. Presentation.
